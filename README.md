## Family Tracker (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + EJS)

This is a Node.js web application that allows users to track countries visited by family members. Users can switch between family members, add new users, and log visited countries. The app uses PostgreSQL for data storage and EJS for rendering dynamic pages.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js – JavaScript runtime
- Express.js – Web server framework
- PostgreSQL – Database to store users and visited countries
- body-parser – Middleware to parse form data
- EJS – Template engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- HTML / CSS / JS – Frontend structure and styling

## Project Summary
This project provides a family tracker system where multiple users can log the countries they have visited.
It connects to a PostgreSQL database, handles user switching, and dynamically displays visited countries on the front-end using EJS templates.

## Features
- Add new family members with name and color
- Switch between users
- Log visited countries for each user
- Display total visited countries per user
- Store data persistently in PostgreSQL
- Runs on port 3001
